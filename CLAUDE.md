# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## What this repo is

A desktop simulator for [CrossPoint](https://github.com/crosspoint-reader/crosspoint-reader) firmware. It is **not** a standalone app, it ships as a PlatformIO library that downstream firmware adds as a `lib_dep` (named `simulator_mock`) and builds with `platform = native` and `-DSIMULATOR`. The result is the firmware compiled as a host binary, with the e-ink display rendered into an SDL2 window.

There is no build target inside this repo. Build and run happen in the consuming firmware project. See [README.md](README.md) for end-user setup, and [.claude/CONTEXT-sim-notes.md](.claude/CONTEXT-sim-notes.md) for the deep architecture notes and bug-fix history (read this before non-trivial changes).

## Build and run (from the consuming firmware repo)

```bash
pio run -e simulator -t run_simulator   # build + launch
pio run -e simulator                    # build only, then .pio/build/simulator/program
rm -rf ./fs_/.crosspoint/               # clear stale on-disk caches after storage/cache changes
```

For local dev against this repo, the firmware's `platformio.ini` should reference it as `simulator=symlink://../crosspoint-simulator` instead of the git URL.

There are no tests, no linter, and no per-file build commands. A change is "tested" by running the simulator and exercising the affected feature.

## Architecture

The simulator is a collection of host-side reimplementations of the firmware's hardware abstraction layer (HAL) and its Arduino/ESP-IDF dependencies. Each `Hal*.cpp/.h` here corresponds to a `Hal*` class in the firmware's `lib/hal/`, and **must keep the same public surface** or the firmware will not link.

**The HAL stub rule.** When the firmware adds a new method to a HAL class and calls it, the simulator fails to link until a matching stub is added to the corresponding `Hal*.cpp` here. Most additions are one-line no-ops. This is the single most common reason a simulator build breaks after pulling firmware updates.

**Why the simulator's design has the shape it does** (the non-obvious parts):

- **SDL on main thread.** macOS requires all SDL calls to come from the main thread, but firmware drives rendering from a FreeRTOS render task. The split lives in [src/HalDisplay.cpp](src/HalDisplay.cpp): `refreshDisplay` (background thread) converts the 1bpp framebuffer to ARGB and sets an atomic `pendingPresent` flag. `presentIfNeeded` (called from `simulator_main` on the main thread) does the actual SDL upload and present. Do not call SDL render functions from anywhere else.
- **Orientation rotation lives in two places.** The firmware's renderer rotates content into the 800x480 framebuffer (90 CCW for `Portrait`). The simulator undoes that with `SDL_RenderCopyEx`. If you change one, change the other. The dst rect is landscape-shaped and centre-offset because `SDL_RenderCopyEx` rotates around the dst centre.
- **HiDPI / dithering.** Set `SDL_HINT_RENDER_SCALE_QUALITY=1` *before* `SDL_CreateTexture`, plus `SDL_WINDOW_ALLOW_HIGHDPI` and `SDL_RenderSetLogicalSize`. Without all three, Bayer-dithered grays render as harsh black/white stripes on Retina.
- **POSIX fds, not std::fstream, in [src/HalStorage.cpp](src/HalStorage.cpp).** This was a deliberate rewrite. fstream's separate get/put pointers, eofbit-blocks-seek behaviour, and write-only seek restrictions caused several silent-corruption bugs. Do not reintroduce fstream here. All paths are prefixed with `./fs_` so the simulated filesystem stays sandboxed under the binary's working directory; `/books/` on the SD card maps to `./fs_/books/`. Directory iteration skips entries starting with `.`.
- **FreeRTOS shim.** [src/freertos/](src/freertos/) maps `xTaskCreate` to `std::thread`, task notifies to a condvar + counter, and `SemaphoreHandle_t` to `std::recursive_mutex`. A `thread_local SimTaskHandle*` lets each task thread find its own handle.
- **`_exit(0)` not `return 0`.** [src/simulator_main.cpp](src/simulator_main.cpp) ends with `_exit(0)` after `SDL_Quit()` to skip C++ global destructors. The render task is `[[noreturn]]`, so running destructors while it is mid-render races and produces a "quit unexpectedly" dialog. Keep this.
- **Time uses `steady_clock`.** `millis()` / `micros()` in [src/Arduino.h](src/Arduino.h) deliberately use `steady_clock`, not `system_clock`, so wall-clock changes do not perturb timing.

**Host-specific code paths:**

- MD5: macOS includes [src/MD5Builder.h](src/MD5Builder.h) (CommonCrypto), Linux/WSL includes [src/MD5Builder_linux.h](src/MD5Builder_linux.h) (OpenSSL). The downstream firmware swaps which header it pulls in per host.
- Build flags: macOS uses `-arch arm64` and `/opt/homebrew/{include,lib}`; Linux/WSL adds `-lssl -lcrypto -Wno-deprecated-declarations` (OpenSSL 3.x deprecates `MD5_*`). See [sample-platformio-macos.ini](sample-platformio-macos.ini) and [sample-platformio-linux-wsl.ini](sample-platformio-linux-wsl.ini). Keep both in sync when build flags change. Native Windows is not supported, WSL is.

## Input mapping (lives in [src/HalGPIO.cpp](src/HalGPIO.cpp))

`HalGPIO::update` owns the SDL event pump for the whole simulator, do not poll SDL events elsewhere. Scancodes map to button indices `BTN_BACK=0` through `BTN_POWER=6`. `SDL_QUIT` sets the `quitRequested` atomic that `HalDisplay::shouldQuit()` reads.

## When making changes

- Adding a new HAL method? Mirror the firmware signature exactly and stub it (usually no-op) in the matching `Hal*.cpp/.h`. Do not invent new public methods that don't exist in the firmware HAL.
- Adding a new Arduino/ESP-IDF symbol? Add the minimum stub to the corresponding header in [src/](src/) (e.g. [src/WiFi.h](src/WiFi.h), [src/Arduino.h](src/Arduino.h)). Match the upstream signature, return a sensible default.
- Touching storage or caching code? After the change, `rm -rf ./fs_/.crosspoint/` in the firmware project before re-running, otherwise stale caches built by the old code will mask the fix.
- Touching display, threading, or shutdown? Re-read the "Why the simulator's design has the shape it does" section above first. Several of those decisions undo subtle bugs that will resurface if reverted.
